Today I debugged my program to get a working app. I realized I made a few dumb mistakes such as leaving code I used for doing small tests. This
screwed with the flow of my program. Originally, I couldn't get anything to show up on the DSL and I kept getting segmentation faults. This is
because I didn't allocate enough memory per variable on the stack (that holds the addresses). I made the stack elements 1 byte each; however the
addresses possible (0 - 4095) can be greater than 2^8.

I have a working app; however, I believe my code is unclean and cluttered. Next time, I will organize my code and produce the final product.
