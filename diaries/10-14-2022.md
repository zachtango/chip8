I feel much more refreshed today. I've cleaned up my code and organized it better. I like my app in its current state so I won't be developing
the emulator any further. Some further enhancements could be to include implementing the instruction set of the SuperChip8; however, I want
to move on to emulating the GameBoy. The GameBoy will be a much bigger challenge in terms of visuals, sounds, and instructions. I didn't
implement any sounds in this emulator either, so that could be an enhancement as well.
