I worked on implementing the I/O using the SDL2 library for graphics and keyboard input. Today was probably the hardest day of all
because the SDL2 library is quite complex. I spent hours reading the documentation to understand how to best render the bits
in the video array using SDL2. I'm not going to lie; this was very difficult and complicated, and I still don't understand
some things.

After finishing my Device class that implemented the SDL2 library, I tried to put it all together to run. I was able to compile
my program successfuly. My program starts out fine and opens correctly; however, I get a segmentation fault whenever I input anything
through the keyboard. I will have to debug this tomorrow.
